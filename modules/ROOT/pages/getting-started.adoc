= Fedora CoreOS - Getting Started

Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) has no install-time configuration. Every FCOS system begins with a generic disk image. For each deployment mechanism (cloud VM, local VM, bare metal), configuration can be supplied at first boot. FCOS reads and applies the configuration file with https://github.com/coreos/ignition[Ignition]. For cloud deployments, Ignition gathers the configuration via the cloudâ€™s user-data mechanism. In the case of bare metal, Ignition injects the configuration at install time.

NOTE: For more information on configuration, refer to the documentation for xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

== Launching FCOS

=== Launching in a cloud

Follow the corresponding guide for xref:provisioning-aws.adoc[Amazon Web Services], xref:provisioning-azure.adoc[Azure], or xref:provisioning-digitalocean.adoc[DigitalOcean] to launch an instance of Fedora CoreOS.

=== Launching in a virtual machine hypervisor

Follow the corresponding guide for xref:provisioning-qemu.adoc[QEMU or libvirt] or xref:provisioning-vmware.adoc[VMware] to launch an instance of Fedora CoreOS.

== Installing on bare metal

Follow the xref:bare-metal.adoc[bare metal installation instructions] to install Fedora CoreOS to disk. This procedure injects the specified Ignition configuration at install time.
